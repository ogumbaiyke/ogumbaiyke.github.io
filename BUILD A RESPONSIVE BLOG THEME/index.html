    <h2>Why Do Trust Issues Come From ?</h2>
    <p>Trust can take years to develop, but it can be destroyed in an instant. People who have issues with trust have often had significant negative experiences in the past with individuals or organizations they initially deemed trustworthy. For example, studies show that children of divorced parents and those from abusive households are more likely to have intimacy, commitment, and trust issues in future relationships.

While trust issues sometimes develop from negative interactions experienced during early childhood, social rejection during adolescence or traumatic experiences during adulthood can also lead to trust issues for an individual. Betrayal in the form of infidelity in romantic relationships can cause trust issues throughout a person’s life. Significant loss of financial resources or perceived injustice at the hands of authority figures can even cause strong feelings of mistrust toward institutions rather than people. The fragile state of the nation’s economy, for example, has resulted in many people losing trust in the banking system and government organizations.

<p>In short, when a person’s trust is repeatedly violated, his or her belief system can be affected profoundly, causing future concerns with placing trust in people or organizations.</p>

    <h2>Why You Need To Set High Standards For Yourself</h2>
    <p>A standard is a statement about how you live your life, for example, I am a person who is always positive. It specifies what is the level of behavior that you follow. To raise the quality of your life, set higher standards. To achieve financial security, you could say, I am a person, who saves X percent in order to have a financial reserve.

Standards are things you set for yourself, by no longer putting up with less than what you are capable of doing. When you get into the groove of continuously setting new standards for things you tolerate in yourself, you will elevate your pattern of behavior to higher levels and be able to hold yourself to them. Standards are codes of behavior that you choose to live by because you know they will make your life contended. Because they are the things that you personally honor, you need not declare them to the outside world. The standards can be about your work-life balance, health, soul, relationship, approach to finances, and just about any area of life that you wish to improve. The standards are about who you are now, not the promise of what you will become.

People, who set low standards, usually don’t realize it because whatever standards they have set, seem normal. Picking up the gauntlet to do anything different is initially uncomfortable, however, you will not achieve your true potential and will continue to operate on a drain basis. Having low standards entails breaking promises made to oneself and feeling guilty about it. You may be left with a feeling of being cheated because you did not do what could have been doable with your caliber, all this drains energy. People with low standards, tend to run on a low emotional charge, they don’t love or respect themselves enough. A negative spiral begins when self-esteem drops and one doubt’s one’s self-worth. This in turn impacts self-esteem and the cycle repeats itself.</p>
